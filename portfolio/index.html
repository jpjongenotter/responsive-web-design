        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          These are the projects I have developed for the freeCodeCamp
          Responsive Web Design curriculum. The goal of doing these projects was
          to understand the basics of responsive web design using only HTML and
          CSS. Styling of the projects has been kept minimal, these could be
          improved greatly but I am moving on.
