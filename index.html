          Highlights of Bruce Springsteen's discography
        </h2>
        <p></p>
          October 23rd, Bruce Springsteen is releasing his latest album <em>'Letter To You'</em>.
          Since debuting in 1973 with <em>'Greetings from Ashbury Park, N.J.'</em> this marks his 20th studio album.
          In his live shows, that regularly exceed three hours, he can pick from this large backlog of album tracks.
          Spectators have created a habit of writing down songs they want to hear on a piece of cardboard.
          All are hoping their favourite song is being played during the concert. Regularly this includes less well-known album tracks.
