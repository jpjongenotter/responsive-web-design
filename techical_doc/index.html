          If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it.
          This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast
          majority of the things you'll eventually spend your time doing with
          Git. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and
          initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and
          commit changes. We'll also show you how to set up Git to ignore
          certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and
          easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes
          between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

      <section id="Getting_a_Git_Repository" class="main-section">
        <header>Getting a Git Repository</header>
        <p>You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You can take a local directory that is currently not under version
            control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
          </li>
          <li>
            You can <em>clone</em> an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local
          machine, ready for work.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section
        id="Initializing_a_Repository_in_an_Existing_Directory"
        class="main-section"
      >
        <header>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</header>
        <p>
          If you have a project directory that is currently not under version
          control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need
          to go to that project's directory. If you've never done this, it looks
          a little different depending on which system you're running:
        </p>
        <p>for Linux:</p>
        <code>$ cd /home/user/my_project</code>
        <p>for macOS:</p>
        <code>$ cd /Users/user/my_project</code>
        <p>for Windows:</p>
        <code>$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project</code>
        <p>and type:</p>
        <code>$ git init</code>
        <p>
          This creates a new subdirectory named
          <span class="highlight">.git</span> that contains all of your
          necessary repository files -- a Git repository skeleton. At this
          point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. See Git Internals for
          more information about exactly what files are contained in the
          <span class="highlight">.git</span>
          directory you just created.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to
          an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files
          and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few
          <span class="highlight">git add</span> commands that specify the files
          you want to track, followed by a
          <span class="highlight">git commit</span>:
        </p>
        <code
          >$ git add *.c<br />
          $ git add LICENSE<br />
          $ git commit -m 'Initial project version'</code
        >
        <p>
          We'll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point,
          you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Cloning_an_Existing_Repository" class="main-section">
        <header>Cloning an Existing Repository</header>
        <p>
          If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository -- for
          example, a project you'd like to contribute to -- the command you need
          is <span class="highlight">git clone</span>. If you're familiar with
          other VCS systems such as Subversion, you'll notice that the command
          is "clone" and not "checkout". This is an important distinction --
          instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of
          nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for
          the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run
          <span class="highlight">git clone</span>. In fact, if your server disk
          gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any
          client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was
          cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the
          versioned data would be there -- see Getting Git on a Server for more
          details).
        </p>
        <p>
          You clone a repository with
          <span class="highlight">git clone &lt;url&gt;</span>. For example, if
          you want to clone the Git linkable library called
          <span class="highlight">libgit2</span>, you can do so like this:
        </p>
        <code>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</code>
        <p>
          That creates a directory named <span class="highlight">libgit2</span>,
          initializes a <span class="highlight">.git</span> directory inside it,
          pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working
          copy of the latest version. If you go into the new
          <span class="highlight">libgit2</span> directory that was just
          created, you'll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on
          or used.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something
          other than <span class="highlight">libgit2</span>, you can specify the
          new directory name as an additional argument:
        </p>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit </code>
        <p>
          That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target
          directory is called <span class="highlight">mylibgit</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The
          previous example uses the
          <span class="highlight">https://</span> protocol, but you may also see
          <span class="highlight">git://</span> or
          <span class="highlight">user@server:path/to/repo.git</span>, which
          uses the SSH transfer protocol. Getting Git on a Server will introduce
          all of the available options the server can set up to access your Git
          repository and the pros and cons of each.

      </section>
      <section id="Recording_Changes_to_the_Repository" class="main-section">
        <header>Recording Changes to the Repository</header>
        <p>
          At this point, you should have a <em>bona fide</em> Git repository on
          your local machine, and a checkout or <em>working copy</em> of all of
          its files in front of you. Typically, you'll want to start making
          changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository
          each time the project reaches a state you want to record.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two
          states: <em>tracked</em> or <em>untracked</em>. Tracked files are
          files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified,
          modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Untracked files are everything else - any files in your working
          directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your
          staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files
          will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and
          you haven't edited anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you've changed
          them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these
          modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle
          repeats.

      <section id="Checking_the_Status_of_Your_Files" class="main-section">
        <header>Checking the Status of Your Files</header>
        <p>
          The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is
          the <span class="highlight">git status</span> command. If you run this
          command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:
        </p>
        <code
          >$ git status<br />
          On branch master<br />
          Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. nothing to commit,
          working directory clean</code
        >
        <p>
          This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of
          your tracked files are modified. Git also doesn't see any untracked
          files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you
          which branch you're on and informs you that it has not diverged from
          the same 27 branch on the server. For now, that branch is always
          <span class="highlight">master</span>, which is the default; you won't
          worry about it here. Git Branching will go over branches and
          references in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say you add a new file to your project, a simple
          <span class="highlight">README</span> file. If the file didn't exist
          before, and you run <span class="highlight">git status</span>, you see
          your untracked file like so:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
$ echo 'My Project' > README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
                  
    README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</code>
            </pre>
        <p>
          You can see that your new <span class="highlight">README</span> file
          is untracked, because it's under the "Untracked files" heading in your
          status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you
          didn't have in the previous snapshot (commit); Git won't start
          including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to
          do so. It does this so you don't accidentally begin including
          generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to
          include. You do want to start including
          <span class="highlight">README</span>, so let's start tracking the
          file.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Tracking_New_Files" class="main-section">
        <header>Tracking New Files</header>
        <p>
          In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command
          <span class="highlight">git add</span>. To begin tracking the
          <span class="highlight">README</span> file, you can run this:
        </p>
        <code>$ git add README</code>
        <p>
          If you run your status command again, you can see that your
          <span class="highlight">README</span> file is now tracked and staged
          to be committed:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file: README</code>
           </pre>
        <p>
          You can tell that it's staged because it's under the "Changes to be
          committed" heading. If you commit at this point, the version of the
          file at the time you ran <span class="highlight">git add</span> is
          what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot. You may recall
          that when you ran <span class="highlight">git init</span> earlier, you
          then ran <span class="highlight">git add &lt;files&gt;</span> -- that
          was to begin tracking files in your directory. The
          <span class="highlight">git add</span> command takes a path name for
          either a file or a directory; if it's a directory, the command adds
          all the files in that directory recursively.
        </p>

          Let's change a file that was already tracked. If you change a
          previously tracked file called
          <span class="highlight">CONTRIBUTING.md</span> and then run your
          <span class="highlight">git status</span> command again, you get
          something that looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file: README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="highlight">CONTRIBUTING.md</span> file appears under
          a section named "Changes not staged for commit" -- which means that a
          file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but
          not yet staged. To stage it, you run the
          <span class="highlight">git add</span> command.
          <span class="highlight">git add</span> is a multipurpose command --
          you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do
          other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may
          be helpful to think of it more as "add precisely this content to the
          next commit" rather than "add this file to the project". Let's run
          <span class="highlight">git add</span> now to stage the
          <span class="highlight">CONTRIBUTING.md</span> file, and then run
          <span class="highlight">git status</span> again:
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file: README
    modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
        <p>
          Both files are staged and will go into your next commit. At this
          point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in
          <span class="highlight">CONTRIBUTING.md</span> before you commit it.
          You open it again and make that change, and you're ready to commit.
          However, let's run <span class="highlight">git status</span> one more
          time:
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ vim CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file: README
    modified: CONTRIBUTING.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
        <p>
          What the heck? Now <span class="highlight">CONTRIBUTING.md</span> is
          listed as both staged and unstaged. How is that possible? It turns out
          that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the
          <span class="highlight">git add</span> command. If you commit now, the
          version of <span class="highlight">CONTRIBUTING.md</span> as it was
          when you last ran the <span class="highlight">git add</span> command
          is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it
          looks in your working directory when you run
          <span class="highlight">git commit</span>. If you modify a file after
          you run <span class="highlight">git add</span>, you have to run
          <span class="highlight">git add</span> again to stage the latest
          version of the file:
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file: README
    modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="Short_Status" class="main-section">
        <header>Short Status</header>
        <p>
          While the <span class="highlight">git status</span> output is pretty
          comprehensive, it's also quite wordy. Git also has a short status flag
          so you can see your changes in a more compact way. If you run
          <span class="highlight">git status -s</span> or
          <span class="highlight">git status --short</span> you get a far more
          simplified output from the command:
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ git status -s
  M README
 MM Rakefile
A lib/git.rb
M lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt</code></pre>
        <p>
          New files that aren't tracked have a
          <span class="highlight">??</span> next to them, new files that have
          been added to the staging area have an
          <span class="highlight">A</span>, modified files have an
          <span class="highlight">M</span> and so on. There are two columns to
          the output -- the left- hand column indicates the status of the
          staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the
          working tree. So for example in that output, the
          <span class="highlight">README</span> file is modified in the working
          directory but not yet staged, while the
          <span class="highlight">lib/simplegit.rb</span> file is modified and
          staged. The <span class="highlight">Rakefile</span> was modified,
          staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are
          both staged and unstaged.

        <p>
          Often, you'll have a class of files that you don't want Git to
          automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are
          generally automatically generated files such as log files or files
          produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file
          listing patterns to match them named
          <span class="highlight">.gitignore</span>. Here is an example
          <span class="highlight">.gitignore</span> file:
        </p>
        <code
          >$ cat .gitignore<br />
          *.[oa]<br />
          *~</code
        >
        <p>
          The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in ".o" or ".a" --
          object and archive files that may be the product of building your
          code. The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end
          with a tilde (~), which is used by many text editors such as Emacs to
          mark temporary files. You may also include a log, tmp, or pid
          directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on. Setting
          up a <span class="highlight">.gitignore</span> file for your new
          repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don't
          accidentally commit files that you really don't want in your Git
          repository.
        </p>

          The rules for the patterns you can put in the
          <span class="highlight">.gitignore</span> file are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Blank lines or lines starting with
            <span class="highlight">#</span> are ignored.
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively
            throughout the entire working tree.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can start patterns with a forward slash (<span class="highlight"
              >/</span
            >) to avoid recursivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can end patterns with a forward slash (<span class="highlight"
              >/</span
            >) to specify a directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point
            (<span class="highlight">!</span>).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.
          An asterisk (<span class="highlight">*</span>) matches zero or more
          characters; <span class="highlight">[abc]</span> matches any character
          inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (<span
            class="highlight"
            >?</span
          >) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters
          separated by a hyphen (<span class="highlight">[0-9]</span>) matches
          any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also
          use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/*/z would match a/z,
          a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.
