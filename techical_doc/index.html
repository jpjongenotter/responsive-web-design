        <p>
          If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it.
          This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast
          majority of the things you'll eventually spend your time doing with
          Git. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and
          initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and
          commit changes. We'll also show you how to set up Git to ignore
          certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and
          easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes
          between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

      <section id="Getting_a_Git_Repository" class="main-section">
        <header>Getting a Git Repository</header>
        <p>You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You can take a local directory that is currently not under version
            control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
          </li>
          <li>
            You can <em>clone</em> an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local
          machine, ready for work.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section
        id="Initializing_a_Repository_in_an_Existing_Directory"
        class="main-section"
      >
        <header>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</header>
        <p>
          If you have a project directory that is currently not under version
          control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need
          to go to that project's directory. If you've never done this, it looks
          a little different depending on which system you're running:
        </p>
        <p>for Linux:</p>
        <code>$ cd /home/user/my_project</code>
        <p>for macOS:</p>
        <code>$ cd /Users/user/my_project</code>
        <p>for Windows:</p>
        <code>$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project</code>
        <p>and type:</p>
        <code>$ git init</code>
        <p>
          This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your
          necessary repository files -- a Git repository skeleton. At this point,
          nothing in your project is tracked yet. See Git Internals for more
          information about exactly what files are contained in the .git
          directory you just created.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to
          an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files
          and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add
          commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git
          commit:
        </p>
        <code
          >$ git add *.c<br />
          $ git add LICENSE<br />
          $ git commit -m 'Initial project version'</code
        >
        <p>
          We'll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point,
          you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Cloning_an_Existing_Repository" class="main-section">
        <header>Cloning an Existing Repository</header>
        <p>
          If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository -- for example,
          a project you'd like to contribute to -- the command you need is git
          clone. If you're familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion,
          you'll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout". This is
          an important distinction -- instead of getting just a working copy, Git
          receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every
          version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by
          default when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets
          corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to
          set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may
          lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would
          be there -- see Getting Git on a Server for more details).
        </p>
        <p>You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:
        </p>
        <code>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</code>
        <p>That creates a directory named libgit2, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new libgit2 directory that was just created, you'll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.</p>
        <p>If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than libgit2, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:</p>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
        </code>
        <p>That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mylibgit.</p>
        <p>Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the https:// protocol, but you may also see git:// or user@server:path/to/repo.git, which uses the SSH transfer protocol. Getting Git on a Server will introduce all of the available options the server can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each.</p>

      <section id="Recording_Changes_to_the_Repository" class="main-section">
        <header>Recording Changes to the Repository</header>
        <p>At this point, you should have a <em>bona fide</em> Git repository on your local machine, and a checkout or <em>working copy</em> of all of its files in front of you. Typically, you'll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.
        </p>
        <p>Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: <em>tracked</em> or <em>untracked</em>. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.</p>
        <p>Untracked files are everything else - any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven't edited anything.</p>
        <p>As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you've changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="Checking_the_Status_of_Your_Files" class="main-section">
        <header>Checking the Status of Your Files</header>
        <p>The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:
        </p>
        <code>$ git status<br>
          On branch master<br>
          Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. nothing to commit, working directory clean</code>
          <p>This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are modified. Git also doesn't see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you which branch you're on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same
            27
          branch on the server. For now, that branch is always master, which is the default; you won't worry about it here. Git Branching will go over branches and references in detail.</p>
          <p>Let's say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file. If the file didn't exist before, and you run git status, you see your untracked file like so:</p>
          <code>$ echo 'My Project' > README<br>
            $ git status<br>
            On branch master<br>
            Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.<br>Untracked files:<br>
            (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)<br><br>   README<br><br>
              nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</code>
              <p>You can see that your new README file is untracked, because it's under the "Untracked files" heading in your status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn't have in the previous snapshot (commit); Git won't start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so. It does this so you don't accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include. You do want to start including README, so let's start tracking the file.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Tracking_New_Files" class="main-section">
        <header>Tracking New Files</header>
        <p>In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. To begin tracking the README file, you can run this:
        </p>
        <code>$ git add README</code>
        <p>If you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged to be committed:</p>
        <code>$ git status<br>
          On branch master<br>
          Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.<br>Changes to be committed:<br>
           (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)<br><br>    new file: README</code>
            <p>You can tell that it's staged because it's under the "Changes to be committed" heading. If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran git add is what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot. You may recall that when you ran git init earlier, you then ran git add <files> -- that was to begin tracking files in your directory. The git add command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if it's a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory recursively.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Staging_Modified_Files" class="main-section">
        <header>Staging Modified Files</header>
        <p>Let's change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called CONTRIBUTING.md and then run your git status command again, you get something that looks like this:
        </p>
        <code>$ git status<br>
          On branch master<br>
          Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.<br>
          Changes to be committed:<br>
            (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)<br><br>
              new file: README<br><br>
          Changes not staged for commit:<br>
            (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)<br>
            (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)<br><br>
              modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code>
              <p>The CONTRIBUTING.md file appears under a section named "Changes not staged for commit" -- which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the git add command. git add is a multipurpose command -- you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as "add precisely this content to the next commit" rather than "add this file to the project". Let's run git add now to stage the CONTRIBUTING.md file, and then run git status again:</p>
              <code>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md<br>
                $ git status<br>
                On branch master<br>
                Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.<br>
                Changes to be committed:<br>
                (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)<br><br>
                  new file: README<br>
                  modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code>
                  <p>Both files are staged and will go into your next commit. At this point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in CONTRIBUTING.md before you commit it. You open it again and make that change, and you're ready to commit. However, let's run git status one more time:</p>
                  <code> $ vim CONTRIBUTING.md<br>
                    $ git status<br>
                    On branch master<br>
                    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.<br>
                    Changes to be committed:<br>
                    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)<br><br>
                    new file: README<br>
                    modified: CONTRIBUTING.md<br><br>
                    Changes not staged for commit:<br>
                    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)<br>
                    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)<br><br>
                    modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code>
                    <p>What the heck? Now CONTRIBUTING.md is listed as both staged and unstaged. How is that possible? It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the git add command. If you commit now, the version of CONTRIBUTING.md as it was when you last ran the git add command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run git commit. If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file:</p>
                    <code>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md<br>
                      $ git status<br>
                      On branch master<br>
                      Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.<br>
                      Changes to be committed:<br>
                      (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)<br><br>
                      new file: README<br>
                      modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code>
      </section>
      <section id="Short_Status" class="main-section">
        <header>Short Status</header>
        <p>While the git status output is pretty comprehensive, it's also quite wordy. Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way. If you run git status -s or git status --short you get a far more simplified output from the command:
        </p>
        <code>$ git status -s<br>
          M README<br>
          MM Rakefile<br>
          A lib/git.rb<br>
          M lib/simplegit.rb<br>
          ?? LICENSE.txt</code>
          <p>New files that aren't tracked have a ?? next to them, new files that have been added to the staging area have an A, modified files have an M and so on. There are two columns to the output -- the left- hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree. So for example in that output, the README file is modified in the working directory but not yet staged, while the lib/simplegit.rb file is modified and staged. The Rakefile was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Ignoring_Files" class="main-section">
        <header>Ignoring Files</header>
        <p>Often, you'll have a class of files that you don't want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named .gitignore. Here is an example .gitignore file:
        </p>
        <code>$ cat .gitignore<br>
          *.[oa]<br>
          *~</code>
          <p>The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in ".o" or ".a" -- object and archive files that may be the product of building your code. The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde (~), which is used by many text editors such as Emacs to mark temporary files. You may also include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on. Setting up a .gitignore file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don't accidentally commit files that you really don't want in your Git repository.</p>
          <p>The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.</li>
            <li>Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.</li>
            <li>You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.</li>
            <li>You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.</li>
            <li>You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk () matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (?) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen ([0-9]) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use
            two asterisks to match nested directories; a/*/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.</p>
